Part 1: Questions

1- This code is about managing the stock and its quality over days.

2- All the goods stored in the Guilded Rose can be identified clearly.

3- When the day is over the sellin decreases by 1 and the quality change either by decreasing 
 or by increasing (by 1 or by 2).

4- The sellin decreases by 1 each day, When the sellin is positive the quality increases
 by 1 and when the sellin is negative the quality increases by 2 until it reaches 50.

5- when a concert ticket goes over its expiration day its quality will be 0.

6- The excess of if conditions which are not well organized make this code difficult to read.

7- I don't think that the rules are are clear enough so that you could rework the entire 
 solution from scratch.
